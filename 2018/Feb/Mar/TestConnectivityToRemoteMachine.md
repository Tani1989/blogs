# Test Network Connectivity 

Most of the code I write, involves connectivity to remote services via HTTP API's. Following steps are a prerequiste before I start to write the actual implementation details. You might find these helpful in case you need to verify the connectivity to remote machines. 

1. The first step in this process is to verify the **Network** connectivity with the remote machine.

2. Verify the Connectivity to the Destination port.

Using the **Ping** command, we can verify the network level connectivity between client and Remote Machines.
